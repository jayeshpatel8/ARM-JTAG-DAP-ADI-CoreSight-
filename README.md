# ARM-JTAG-DAP-ADI-CoreSight for :
    (1) System Memroy Access, (2) Peripheral Access, (3) Execute CPU Instructions

To creat your own JTAG Debugging & Control Interface using GPIO for ARM JTAG DAP Coresight HW, this information is gethered.

What you need:
  - 4/5 HW GPIO PIN (for implementing TAP Signals: TDI,TDO,TMS,TCK , TRST is optional)
  - Software JTAG libarary for TAP Controller
  - Driver for ARM DAP Interface for: 
        (1) System Memroy Access
        (2) Peripheral Access
        (3) Execute CPU Instructions  
        (4) How to configure DP supporting 
        (5) How to access AP
